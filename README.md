**Open-Pay is the AI-native, open-source alternative to Weave, Stripe, and PatientPop, designed to be the all-in-one operating system for modern service businesses.**

This project is a community-driven initiative to build a unified platform integrating payment processing, customer engagement, and business growth tools. We are inspired by the innovations of leaders like **Stripe**, **Block (Square)**, **Weave**, **EverCommerce**, **Solutionreach**, and **PatientPop**, but we believe in a future that is open, customizable, and accessible to everyone.

Built for the way the world works today, Open-Pay leverages the power of AI to automate workflows, provide intelligent insights, and create seamless experiences for both businesses and their customers.

## 🔭 Our Vision

In today's fragmented market, businesses are forced to juggle multiple vendors for payments, communication, scheduling, and marketing. This creates data silos, increases costs, and leads to disjointed customer experiences.

Our vision is to create a single, open-source platform that consolidates these essential services. By building on a modern, AI-first architecture, Open-Pay will empower businesses to streamline operations, foster meaningful customer relationships, and drive growth—all from one place.
