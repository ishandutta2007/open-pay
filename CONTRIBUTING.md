# Contributing to Open-Pay

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Open-Pay! It's people like you that make the open-source community such a great place. We welcome contributions of all kinds, from code and documentation to design and feedback.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Open-Pay Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [project-maintainers@example.com](mailto:project-maintainers@example.com).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

-   **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/example/open-pay/issues).
-   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/example/open-pay/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

-   Open a new issue to discuss your enhancement suggestion. Please provide a clear description of the enhancement and its potential benefits.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Open-Pay? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

-   [Good first issues](https://github.com/example/open-pay/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
-   [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/example/open-pay/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

-   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
-   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
-   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
-   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Code Styleguide

-   We follow the standard style guidelines for the relevant languages and frameworks.
